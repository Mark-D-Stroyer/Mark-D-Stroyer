Hi, I’m @Mark-D-Stroyer basically everywhere. 
I'm a small business owner and lifetime tech enthusiast turned IT and sysadmin by necessity. 
I've always had a stronger proficiency in hardware over software, and have a small electronics repair business, but I have a longstanding fascination with higher-end server capabilties. 
A longtime tinkerer, I'm using my C & Java 101 course from middle school to the fullest extent of my power, and have wrangled my way to a fully armed and operational homelab for small business website production. 
You can reach me over on the Level1Techs Forums: https://forum.level1techs.com/u/mark-d-stroyer/
